I won't be responsible for any module ending up bricked by this application.  
The code is here to show you how a DFU can be done using MLDP via an Android phone.

## Code related
Huge part of this code isn't mine. This is a tweaked version of the application [MLDPTerminal](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MLDPTerminal8.apk) provided by Microchip.
[Source code here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MLDPTerminal%20v3.2-AndroidStudio.zip).

I am currently planning to create an app that will allow to do MLDP communication, remote command and DFU. I may also add other tools to it depending on my free time.

And yes, if you're wondering if I will more readable code (my part of the code, not Microchip's one, they did an awesome commenting job), I'll do make it better (and add comments).
